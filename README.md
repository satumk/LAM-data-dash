# LAM-data during Jan2020-May2020 in Finland

My first Dash app uses LAM-data from here: https://aineistot.vayla.fi/lam/reports/LAM/
to show changes in traffic. First 2-3 months show situation before covid-19
pandemic and from March to end of May depict situation during the pandemic.
This is a selection of LAM-points from Finland.
I used this data previously in my studies in data analytics and artificial intelligence.
